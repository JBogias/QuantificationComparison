salmon quant options:


mapping input options:
  -l [ --libType ] arg                  Format string describing the library 
                                        type
  -i [ --index ] arg                    salmon index
  -r [ --unmatedReads ] arg             List of files containing unmated reads 
                                        of (e.g. single-end reads)
  -1 [ --mates1 ] arg                   File containing the #1 mates
  -2 [ --mates2 ] arg                   File containing the #2 mates


basic options:
  -v [ --version ]                      print version string
  -h [ --help ]                         produce help message
  -o [ --output ] arg                   Output quantification directory.
  --seqBias                             Perform sequence-specific bias 
                                        correction.
  --gcBias                              [beta for single-end reads] Perform 
                                        fragment GC bias correction
  -p [ --threads ] arg (=80)            The number of threads to use 
                                        concurrently.
  --incompatPrior arg (=0)              This option sets the prior probability 
                                        that an alignment that disagrees with 
                                        the specified library type (--libType) 
                                        results from the true fragment origin. 
                                        Setting this to 0 specifies that 
                                        alignments that disagree with the 
                                        library type should be "impossible", 
                                        while setting it to 1 says that 
                                        alignments that disagree with the 
                                        library type are no less likely than 
                                        those that do
  -g [ --geneMap ] arg                  File containing a mapping of 
                                        transcripts to genes.  If this file is 
                                        provided salmon will output both 
                                        quant.sf and quant.genes.sf files, 
                                        where the latter contains aggregated 
                                        gene-level abundance estimates.  The 
                                        transcript to gene mapping should be 
                                        provided as either a GTF file, or a in 
                                        a simple tab-delimited format where 
                                        each line contains the name of a 
                                        transcript and the gene to which it 
                                        belongs separated by a tab.  The 
                                        extension of the file is used to 
                                        determine how the file should be 
                                        parsed.  Files ending in '.gtf', '.gff'
                                        or '.gff3' are assumed to be in GTF 
                                        format; files with any other extension 
                                        are assumed to be in the simple format.
                                        In GTF / GFF format, the 
                                        "transcript_id" is assumed to contain 
                                        the transcript identifier and the 
                                        "gene_id" is assumed to contain the 
                                        corresponding gene identifier.
  --meta                                If you're using Salmon on a metagenomic
                                        dataset, consider setting this flag to 
                                        disable parts of the abundance 
                                        estimation model that make less sense 
                                        for metagenomic data.


options specific to mapping mode:
  --discardOrphansQuasi                 [Quasi-mapping mode only] : Discard 
                                        orphan mappings in quasi-mapping mode. 
                                        If this flag is passed then only paired
                                        mappings will be considered toward 
                                        quantification estimates.  The default 
                                        behavior is to consider orphan mappings
                                        if no valid paired mappings exist.  
                                        This flag is independent of the option 
                                        to write the orphaned mappings to file 
                                        (--writeOrphanLinks).
  --noSA                                [Quasi-mapping mode only] : Disable 
                                        selective-alignment in favor of basic 
                                        quasi-mapping. If this flag is passed, 
                                        selective-alignment and alignment 
                                        scoring of reads will be disabled.
  --validateMappings                    [Quasi-mapping mode only] : Validate 
                                        mappings using alignment-based 
                                        verifcation. If this flag is passed, 
                                        mappings will be validated to ensure 
                                        that they could give rise to a 
                                        reasonable alignment before they are 
                                        further used for quantification.
  --consensusSlack arg (=0)             [Quasi-mapping mode only] : The amount 
                                        of slack allowed in the quasi-mapping 
                                        consensus mechanism.  Normally, a 
                                        transcript must cover all hits to be 
                                        considered for mapping.  If this is set
                                        to a fraction, X, greater than 0 (and 
                                        in [0,1)), then a transcript can fail 
                                        to cover up to (100 * X)% of the hits 
                                        before it is discounted as a mapping 
                                        candidate.  The default value of this 
                                        option is 0.2 if --validateMappings is 
                                        given and 0 otherwise.
  --scoreExp arg (=1)                   [Quasi-mapping mode (w / mapping 
                                        validation) only] : The factor by which
                                        sub-optimal alignment scores are 
                                        downweighted to produce a probability. 
                                        If the best alignment score for the 
                                        current read is S, and the score for a 
                                        particular alignment is w, then the 
                                        probability will be computed 
                                        porportional to exp( - scoreExp * (S-w)
                                        ).
  --minScoreFraction arg                [Quasi-mapping mode (w / mapping 
                                        validation) only] : The fraction of the
                                        optimal possible alignment score that a
                                        mapping must achieve in order to be 
                                        considered "valid" --- should be in 
                                        (0,1].
                                        Salmon Default 0.65 and Alevin Default 
                                        0.87
  --decoyThreshold arg (=1)             For an alignemnt to an annotated 
                                        transcript to be considered invalid, it
                                        must have an alignment score < 
                                        (decoyThreshold * bestDecoyScore).  A 
                                        value of 1.0 means that any alignment 
                                        strictly worse than the best decoy 
                                        alignment will be discarded.  A smaller
                                        value will allow reads to be allocated 
                                        to transcripts even if they strictly 
                                        align better to the decoy sequence.
  --ma arg (=2)                         [Quasi-mapping mode (w / mapping 
                                        validation) only] : The value given to 
                                        a match between read and reference 
                                        nucleotides in an alignment.
  --mp arg (=-4)                        [Quasi-mapping mode (w / mapping 
                                        validation) only] : The value given to 
                                        a mis-match between read and reference 
                                        nucleotides in an alignment.
  --go arg (=4)                         [Quasi-mapping mode (w / mapping 
                                        validation) only] : The value given to 
                                        a gap opening in an alignment.
  --ge arg (=2)                         [Quasi-mapping mode (w / mapping 
                                        validation) only] : The value given to 
                                        a gap extension in an alignment.
  --bandwidth arg (=15)                 [Quasi-mapping mode (w / mapping 
                                        validation) only] : The value used for 
                                        the bandwidth passed to ksw2.  A 
                                        smaller bandwidth can make the 
                                        alignment verification run more 
                                        quickly, but could possibly miss valid 
                                        alignments.
  --allowDovetail                       [Quasi-mapping mode only] : allow 
                                        dovetailing mappings.
  --recoverOrphans                      [Quasi-mapping mode only] : Attempt to 
                                        recover the mates of orphaned reads. 
                                        This uses edlib for orphan recovery, 
                                        and so introduces some computational 
                                        overhead, but it can improve 
                                        sensitivity.
  --mimicBT2                            [Quasi-mapping mode (w / mapping 
                                        validation) only] : Set flags to mimic 
                                        parameters similar to Bowtie2 with 
                                        --no-discordant and --no-mixed flags.  
                                        This increases disallows dovetailing 
                                        reads, and discards orphans. Note, this
                                        does not impose the very strict 
                                        parameters assumed by RSEM+Bowtie2, 
                                        like gapless alignments.  For that 
                                        behavior, use the --mimiStrictBT2 flag 
                                        below.
  --mimicStrictBT2                      [Quasi-mapping mode (w / mapping 
                                        validation) only] : Set flags to mimic 
                                        the very strict parameters used by 
                                        RSEM+Bowtie2.  This increases 
                                        --minScoreFraction to 0.8, disallows 
                                        dovetailing reads, discards orphans, 
                                        and disallows gaps in alignments.
  --softclipOverhangs                   [selective-alignment mode only] : Allow
                                        soft-clipping of reads that overhang 
                                        the beginning or ends of the 
                                        transcript.  In this case, the 
                                        overhaning section of the read will 
                                        simply be unaligned, and will not 
                                        contribute or detract from the 
                                        alignment score.  The default policy is
                                        to force an end-to-end alignemnt of the
                                        entire read, so that overhanings will 
                                        result in some deletion of nucleotides 
                                        from the read.
  --fullLengthAlignment                 [selective-alignment mode only] : 
                                        Perform selective alignment over the 
                                        full length of the read, beginning from
                                        the (approximate) initial mapping 
                                        location and using extension alignment.
                                          This is in contrast with the default 
                                        behavior which is to only perform 
                                        alignment between the MEMs in the 
                                        optimal chain (and before the first and
                                        after the last MEM if applicable).  The
                                        default strategy forces the MEMs to 
                                        belong to the alignment, but has the 
                                        benefit that it can discover indels 
                                        prior to the first hit shared between 
                                        the read and reference.
  --hardFilter                          [Quasi-mapping mode (w / mapping 
                                        validation) only] : Instead of 
                                        weighting mappings by their alignment 
                                        score, this flag will discard any 
                                        mappings with sub-optimal alignment 
                                        score.  The default option of 
                                        soft-filtering (i.e. weighting mappings
                                        by their alignment score) usually 
                                        yields slightly more accurate abundance
                                        estimates but this flag may be 
                                        desirable if you want more accurate 
                                        'naive' equivalence classes, rather 
                                        than range factorized equivalence 
                                        classes.
  -z [ --writeMappings ] [=arg(=-)]     If this option is provided, then the 
                                        quasi-mapping results will be written 
                                        out in SAM-compatible format.  By 
                                        default, output will be directed to 
                                        stdout, but an alternative file name 
                                        can be provided instead.
  --fasterMapping                       [Developer]: Disables some extra checks
                                        during quasi-mapping. This may make 
                                        mapping a little bit faster at the 
                                        potential cost of missing some 
                                        difficult alignments.
  --hitFilterPolicy arg (=AFTER)        Determines the policy by which hits are
                                        filtered in selective alignment.  
                                        Filtering hits after chaining (the 
                                        default) is more sensitive, but more 
                                        computationally intensive, because it 
                                        performs the chaining dynamic program 
                                        for all hits.  Filtering before 
                                        chaining is faster, but some true hits 
                                        may be missed.  The options are BEFORE,
                                        AFTER, BOTH and NONE.


advanced options:
  --alternativeInitMode                 [Experimental]: Use an alternative 
                                        strategy (rather than simple 
                                        interpolation between) the online and 
                                        uniform abundance estimates to 
                                        initalize the EM / VBEM algorithm.
  --auxDir arg (=aux_info)              The sub-directory of the quantification
                                        directory where auxiliary information 
                                        e.g. bootstraps, bias parameters, etc. 
                                        will be written.
  --skipQuant                           Skip performing the actual transcript 
                                        quantification (including any Gibbs 
                                        sampling or bootstrapping).
  --dumpEq                              Dump the simple equivalence class 
                                        counts that were computed during 
                                        mapping or alignment.
  -d [ --dumpEqWeights ]                Dump conditional probabilities 
                                        associated with transcripts when 
                                        equivalence class information is being 
                                        dumped to file. Note, this will dump 
                                        the factorization that is actually used
                                        by salmon's offline phase for 
                                        inference.  If you are using 
                                        range-factorized equivalence classes 
                                        (the default) then the same transcript 
                                        set may appear multiple times with 
                                        different associated conditional 
                                        probabilities.
  --minAssignedFrags arg (=10)          The minimum number of fragments that 
                                        must be assigned to the transcriptome 
                                        for quantification to proceed.
  --reduceGCMemory                      If this option is selected, a more 
                                        memory efficient (but slightly slower) 
                                        representation is used to compute 
                                        fragment GC content. Enabling this will
                                        reduce memory usage, but can also 
                                        reduce speed.  However, the results 
                                        themselves will remain the same.
  --biasSpeedSamp arg (=5)              The value at which the fragment length 
                                        PMF is down-sampled when evaluating 
                                        sequence-specific & GC fragment bias.  
                                        Larger values speed up effective length
                                        correction, but may decrease the 
                                        fidelity of bias modeling results.
  --fldMax arg (=1000)                  The maximum fragment length to consider
                                        when building the empirical 
                                        distribution
  --fldMean arg (=250)                  The mean used in the fragment length 
                                        distribution prior
  --fldSD arg (=25)                     The standard deviation used in the 
                                        fragment length distribution prior
  -f [ --forgettingFactor ] arg (=0.65000000000000002)
                                        The forgetting factor used in the 
                                        online learning schedule.  A smaller 
                                        value results in quicker learning, but 
                                        higher variance and may be unstable.  A
                                        larger value results in slower learning
                                        but may be more stable.  Value should 
                                        be in the interval (0.5, 1.0].
  --initUniform                         initialize the offline inference with 
                                        uniform parameters, rather than seeding
                                        with online parameters.
  --maxOccsPerHit arg (=1000)           When collecting "hits" (MEMs), hits 
                                        having more than maxOccsPerHit 
                                        occurrences won't be considered.
  -w [ --maxReadOcc ] arg (=200)        Reads "mapping" to more than this many 
                                        places won't be considered.
  --noLengthCorrection                  [experimental] : Entirely disables 
                                        length correction when estimating the 
                                        abundance of transcripts.  This option 
                                        can be used with protocols where one 
                                        expects that fragments derive from 
                                        their underlying targets without regard
                                        to that target's length (e.g. QuantSeq)
  --noEffectiveLengthCorrection         Disables effective length correction 
                                        when computing the probability that a 
                                        fragment was generated from a 
                                        transcript.  If this flag is passed in,
                                        the fragment length distribution is not
                                        taken into account when computing this 
                                        probability.
  --noSingleFragProb                    Disables the estimation of an 
                                        associated fragment length probability 
                                        for single-end reads or for orphaned 
                                        mappings in paired-end libraries.  The 
                                        default behavior is to consider the 
                                        probability of all possible fragment 
                                        lengths associated with the retained 
                                        mapping.  Enabling this flag (i.e. 
                                        turning this default behavior off) will
                                        simply not attempt to estimate a 
                                        fragment length probability in such 
                                        cases.
  --noFragLengthDist                    [experimental] : Don't consider 
                                        concordance with the learned fragment 
                                        length distribution when trying to 
                                        determine the probability that a 
                                        fragment has originated from a 
                                        specified location.  Normally, 
                                        Fragments with unlikely lengths will be
                                        assigned a smaller relative probability
                                        than those with more likely lengths.  
                                        When this flag is passed in, the 
                                        observed fragment length has no effect 
                                        on that fragment's a priori 
                                        probability.
  --noBiasLengthThreshold               [experimental] : If this option is 
                                        enabled, then no (lower) threshold will
                                        be set on how short bias correction can
                                        make effective lengths. This can 
                                        increase the precision of bias 
                                        correction, but harm robustness.  The 
                                        default correction applies a threshold.
  --numBiasSamples arg (=2000000)       Number of fragment mappings to use when
                                        learning the sequence-specific bias 
                                        model.
  --numAuxModelSamples arg (=5000000)   The first <numAuxModelSamples> are used
                                        to train the auxiliary model parameters
                                        (e.g. fragment length distribution, 
                                        bias, etc.).  After ther first 
                                        <numAuxModelSamples> observations the 
                                        auxiliary model parameters will be 
                                        assumed to have converged and will be 
                                        fixed.
  --numPreAuxModelSamples arg (=5000)   The first <numPreAuxModelSamples> will 
                                        have their assignment likelihoods and 
                                        contributions to the transcript 
                                        abundances computed without applying 
                                        any auxiliary models.  The purpose of 
                                        ignoring the auxiliary models for the 
                                        first <numPreAuxModelSamples> 
                                        observations is to avoid applying these
                                        models before thier parameters have 
                                        been learned sufficiently well.
  --useEM                               Use the traditional EM algorithm for 
                                        optimization in the batch passes.
  --useVBOpt                            Use the Variational Bayesian EM 
                                        [default]
  --rangeFactorizationBins arg (=4)     Factorizes the likelihood used in 
                                        quantification by adopting a new notion
                                        of equivalence classes based on the 
                                        conditional probabilities with which 
                                        fragments are generated from different 
                                        transcripts.  This is a more 
                                        fine-grained factorization than the 
                                        normal rich equivalence classes.  The 
                                        default value (4) corresponds to the 
                                        default used in Zakeri et al. 2017 
                                        (doi: 10.1093/bioinformatics/btx262), 
                                        and larger values imply a more 
                                        fine-grained factorization.  If range 
                                        factorization is enabled, a common 
                                        value to select for this parameter is 
                                        4. A value of 0 signifies the use of 
                                        basic rich equivalence classes.
  --numGibbsSamples arg (=0)            Number of Gibbs sampling rounds to 
                                        perform.
  --noGammaDraw                         This switch will disable drawing 
                                        transcript fractions from a Gamma 
                                        distribution during Gibbs sampling.  In
                                        this case the sampler does not account 
                                        for shot-noise, but only assignment 
                                        ambiguity
  --numBootstraps arg (=0)              Number of bootstrap samples to 
                                        generate. Note: This is mutually 
                                        exclusive with Gibbs sampling.
  --bootstrapReproject                  This switch will learn the parameter 
                                        distribution from the bootstrapped 
                                        counts for each sample, but will 
                                        reproject those parameters onto the 
                                        original equivalence class counts.
  --thinningFactor arg (=16)            Number of steps to discard for every 
                                        sample kept from the Gibbs chain. The 
                                        larger this number, the less chance 
                                        that subsequent samples are 
                                        auto-correlated, but the slower 
                                        sampling becomes.
  -q [ --quiet ]                        Be quiet while doing quantification 
                                        (don't write informative output to the 
                                        console unless something goes wrong).
  --perTranscriptPrior                  The prior (either the default or the 
                                        argument provided via --vbPrior) will 
                                        be interpreted as a transcript-level 
                                        prior (i.e. each transcript will be 
                                        given a prior read count of this value)
  --perNucleotidePrior                  The prior (either the default or the 
                                        argument provided via --vbPrior) will 
                                        be interpreted as a nucleotide-level 
                                        prior (i.e. each nucleotide will be 
                                        given a prior read count of this value)
  --sigDigits arg (=3)                  The number of significant digits to 
                                        write when outputting the 
                                        EffectiveLength and NumReads columns
  --vbPrior arg (=0.01)                 The prior that will be used in the VBEM
                                        algorithm.  This is interpreted as a 
                                        per-transcript prior, unless the 
                                        --perNucleotidePrior flag is also 
                                        given.  If the --perNucleotidePrior 
                                        flag is given, this is used as a 
                                        nucleotide-level prior.  If the default
                                        is used, it will be divided by 1000 
                                        before being used as a nucleotide-level
                                        prior, i.e. the default per-nucleotide 
                                        prior will be 1e-5.
  --writeOrphanLinks                    Write the transcripts that are linked 
                                        by orphaned reads.
  --writeUnmappedNames                  Write the names of un-mapped reads to 
                                        the file unmapped_names.txt in the 
                                        auxiliary directory.
